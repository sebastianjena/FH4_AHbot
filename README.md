# FH-auction

Just a simple script for automated snipe of rare cars in FH4, written in AHK script language and initially made just for myself (it explains the ugly code ðŸ¤”)

update: due to UI updates in Auction House, it no longer works and needs some corrections
Project probably abandoned at the moment.
